Track&Trace Evolution:  driving blockchain-enabled packaging solutions for a sustainable future,track-trace-evolution-driving-blockchain-enabled-packaging-solutions-for-a-sustainable-future,651eafbae761a2b4e1c54bda,651eafbbe761a2b4e1c55101,65687e2299f7487dd8d00986,false,false,Thu Nov 30 2023 12:20:50 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Thu Nov 30 2023 13:10:37 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Wed Aug 21 2024 12:48:56 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/63f3a24533e09e09d583beeb/656889c36e0348ed1f773537_r%26c_pictures_6.jpg,"<h2 id="""">‍<strong id="""">Short Description</strong></h2><p id="""">The intention of this project was to assess and explore the best ways of adopting blockchain-based tech solutions within the packaging industry as a joint effort of adapa and Riddle&amp;Code. The research and integrations achieved during the project allowed the linking of the Internet of Things (IoT) world for plastics production with the digital layer, where blockchain becomes the underlying infrastructure for circular economy applications.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h2 id=""""><strong id="""">Introduction</strong></h2><p id="""">In the dynamic packaging industry, the capability to track every package and vouch for data integrity is not merely a luxury but a necessity for various regulatory and business needs. An effective Track&amp;Trace system is pivotal in building this trust, providing confidence to stakeholders about the authenticity and journey of each product. Blockchain technology offers promising capabilities to enhance cybersecurity, provide transparent notarization, and ensure secure data access. </p><p id="""">The project aimed to equip packages with Universally Unique IDentifiers (UUIDs) and notarize them on the blockchain for adapa's envisioned ""Digital Packaging"" initiative. The idea was to provide the foundation block for secure and transparent data notarization at the machine level. This would enable building the use cases that adapa, as a leading European supplier of highly specialized flexible packaging solutions, would like to execute with their partners and end customers, such as circular economy applications, Carbon dioxide (CO2) footprint tracking and compensation, and many others. The primary challenge involved strategic exploration, development, and validation of this technology integration to reshape the customer experience and reinforce trust in the packaging industry.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h2 id=""""><strong id="""">The Process</strong></h2><p id="""">Following a series of meetings and workshops, the joint research showed that the most feasible solution for tagging every single package made out of the film for adapa is to print the UUID information on the film due to the following benefits:</p><ul id=""""><li id="""">It is more affordable than other tagging options.</li><li id="""">Data capacity can fulfill the requirements.</li><li id="""">Optical codes are more durable compared to other tagging options like near-field communication (NFC) &nbsp;or radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags for this specific production type.</li></ul><p id="""">Following internal testing on the physical layer, adapa opted for Data Matrix as the optical coding solution.</p><p id="""">After eliciting all the requirements, the following process flow was agreed upon for notarizing UUIDs on the distributed ledger technology (DLT):</p><ol id=""""><li id="""">Generate UUIDs using the HW-03 Industry Hardware Wallet, which has an integrated Trust Anchor.</li><li id="""">Print UUIDs in the Data Matrix format.</li><li id="""">Scan printed UUIDs to check the printing quality with an optical code reader.</li><li id="""">Notarize UUIDs along with product data on DLT.</li></ol><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">There are various hardware wallets developed by Riddle&amp;Code for different industries and their requirements. The HW-03 Industry Hardware Wallet was the best fit for this particular use case due to its robust design, many configurable Input/Output (I/O) Ports, and the ability to work with all standard industrial communication protocols. It can execute the required logic for the production process, has wireless and wired options for internet connectivity to interact with the blockchain, and contains the Trust Anchor for signing data to notarize it on the blockchain.</p><p id="""">In total, two trials were conducted to test the capabilities of the physical and digital layers. </p><p id="""">‍</p><h2 id=""""><strong id="""">First Trial </strong></h2><p id="""">The first trial was an essential step for testing the proposed solution and for adapa to explore the speed of the printing process. A successful trial outcome would leverage adapa’s Digital Packaging division’s visibility in the market, showing how important it is for adapa to keep up with cutting-edge technology in its products and processes. Third-party providers were selected to participate in the trial and to provide a printer unit, dedicated software, and code reader unit.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h2 id=""""><strong id="""">Demo Web Application</strong></h2><p id="""">A web application was also developed to showcase the solution’s capabilities. This app works on mobile browsers to help identify packaging products and provides adapa's partners, or the end customer, easy access to trusted product information.</p><p id="""">The web app is accessed by scanning a static QR code on the packaging by default smartphone camera apps that redirect the user to the web app. Then, the user can scan the Data Matrix code containing a specific UUID to check whether it is an original product, and if it is, the relevant product information is displayed.</p><p id="""">The app uses a provider of software development kits for optical code scanning. This allows the app to accurately scan and interpret various optical codes, including 2D codes like Data Matrices. Once a Data Matrix code has been scanned, the app displays only the publicly accessible parts of the relevant product data.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h2 id=""""><strong id="""">The Outcome of the First Trial</strong></h2><p id="""">The proposed solution, developed by the Riddle&amp;Code team, was successfully tested during the trial period. The solution generated a unique UUID for every package, which was compatible with the printing software and unit. In addition, the solution got the validly read code information from the scanner unit for attestation, which allowed it to identify and exclude any incorrect printed codes. Furthermore, the solution was able to attest the valid UUIDs with relevant mockup metadata, which allowed for accurate tracking and identification of packages. Overall, the trial results indicated that the proposed solution is effective and has the potential to be implemented in a real-world setting.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h2 id=""""><strong id="""">Second Trial </strong></h2><p id="""">A second trial was scheduled to test further the physical limitations of the printing process and the following additional features to be applied to the initially proposed solution:</p><ul id=""""><li id="""">Automatic Batch Notarization Testing.</li><li id="""">Grouping of UUIDs as in single packages &gt;&gt; batches &gt;&gt; pallets.</li></ul><p id="""">‍</p><h2 id=""""><strong id="""">The Outcome of the Second Trial</strong></h2><p id="""">The proposed solution was tested on the digital layer for its performance on high-speed production, and on the physical layer, additional hardware was tested for syncing with machine speed at high speeds.</p><p id="""">The operation's digital aspects proved to cater to the physical requirements. Since the data notarization and storing process was decoupled from the reading process and was performed as a batch operation after the reading was finished, tests verified that the digital layer would not have any issues matching the physical production operations and tagging process. It is important to note that different readers have different performances, and this performance was based not only on the reading speed but also on the speed of the data transfer protocol utilized by the reader.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h2 id=""""><strong id="""">Client Testimonial</strong> </h2><p id=""""><em id="""">As key players in the flexible packaging industry, adapa and Riddle&amp;Code both share a commitment to innovation. This collaboration comes as a reflection of their mutual strive towards excellence.</em></p><p id=""""><em id="""">One clear example of that excellence is adapa’s “digital packaging” solution, driven by blockchain technology and featuring laser-engraved UUIDs alongside robust hardware. This implementation ensures a secure, transparent, and cost-effective approach, with the consideration for a digital product passport as well. The successful trials highlight our dedication to cutting-edge technology, demonstrating its potential to create a sustainable and accountable supply chain.</em></p><p id=""""><em id="""">At the same time, Riddle&amp;Code's support has been invaluable in meeting and surpassing trial expectations, playing a crucial role in achieving our targets.
