        <div class="no-margin small">
            <p>Energy consumers with decarbonization pressure are the rule rather than the exception - they want to know more about the product they buy! Existing certificates are not up to the task. They lack precision concerning time, place and source of production and cannot be used throughout the complete supply chain and lifecycle of products. The landscape of existing data interfaces is highly inhomogeneous which leads to massive inefficiencies and error rates in reporting processes. MYPWR'S hardware secured, digital certificates are the superior solution for these issues. They offer proof of time, location and source, real time traceability and cross-sector compatibility (green mobility, materials, heat, etc.) in a highly auditable manner.</p>

        <div class="no-margin small">
            <p>Classic "smart devices" only focus on monitoring and control features. Fancy dashboards are nice, but without the capability to transact, they're just gadgets, leaving the biggest part of the value potential untapped. With MYPWR we help you integrate a hardware wallet into your products, allowing machines to send and receive transactions, a must-have feature to build successful future technology services. Only this allows digital ecosystems to sprout and grow, creating a whole new customer segment for digital service providers.</p>
